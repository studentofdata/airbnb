    "# Airbnb Impact Analysis #\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple exercise in determining the economic impact of Airbnb in Monterey. Referring to the below output you can see the BEA Travel and Tourism Satellite Accounts (TTSAs) and the scrapy output. The scrapy data is the scraped data from Airbnb.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data ##\n",
    "\n",
    "The following R code takes in two datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. http://www.bea.gov/industry/tourism_data.htm\n",
    "2. Scrapy output\n",
    "\n",
    "BEA Data:\n",
    "The TTSAs present a detailed picture of travel and tourism activity and its role in the U.S. economy. These accounts present estimates of expenditures by tourists, or visitors, on 24 types of goods and services. The accounts also present estimates of the income generated by travel and tourism and estimates of output and employment generated by travel and tourism-related industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scrapy Data:\n",
    "All rooms on Airbnb available in Monterey are pulled and processed. I use the number of reviews, availability, and price of the rooms to calculate the total annual expenditure of Airbnb visitors in Monterey. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Process ##\n",
    "\n",
    "I use the Occupancy Model found here: http://www.sfbos.org/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=52601 Marqusee Memo Airbnb and San Francisco: Descriptive Statistics and Academic Research on Page 30. Note, that the Author and the Planning Department released an updated version of this Research in May 2015, but it is not yet available online.\n",
    "\n",
    "After using the Occupancy Model we can calculate the total expenditure on accomodations from travelers using Airbnb. This figure will be used with the BEA TTSA Commodity Output data to estimate the total traveler expenditure by industry in Monterey. Finally we will take the industry expenditure and use the Commodity Output Multipliers to estimate the economic impact by industry for Monterey.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Caveat Emptor ##\n",
    "\n",
    "These BEA estimates are national averages. It is easy to look at the top five industries in Monterey County and realize Monterey has a different economic profile than the national average. However, it is the opinion and attitude of the project that these figures are actually conservative estimates. The hospitality industry composes a large portion of Monterey County's economy. Not only this, but policy will be shaped around STR's and that market is much larger than is what is represented here. Deliberate conservatism was applied at every assumption to the best of the analyst capabilities."
